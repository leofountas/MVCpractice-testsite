# MVC testing

Make a little site.
If the Internet user is not connected, the home page displays “hello stranger”. If the Internet user is connected, the home page displays “hello” + the user’s name.
Make a small menu with the “home” and “admin” buttons.
If you are not connected, by clicking on “admin”, you are redirected to the home page. If you are connected, you arrive on a page with the message “welcome to the secret of the gods!”.   

In the controller: you manage user redirections (connection condition).  

In the model: you manage the session variable data.  

In the view: you manage the display.
